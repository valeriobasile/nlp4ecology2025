- abstract: Green practices are everyday activities that support a sustainable relationship
    between people and the environment. Detecting these practices in social media
    helps track their prevalence and develop recommendations to promote eco-friendly
    actions. This study compares machine learning methods for identifying mentions
    of green waste practices as a multi-label text classification task. We focus on
    transformer-based models, which currently achieve state-of-the-art performance
    across various text classification tasks. Along with encoder-only models, we evaluate
    encoder-decoder and decoder-only architectures, including instruction-based large
    language models. Experiments on the GreenRu dataset, which consists of Russian
    social media texts, show the prevalence of the mBART encoder-decoder model. The
    findings of this study contribute to the advancement of natural language processing
    tools for ecological and environmental research, as well as the broader development
    of multi-label text classification methods in other domains.

  title: 'From Data to Grassroots Initiatives: Leveraging Transformer-Based Models
    for Detecting Green Practices in Social Media'
- abstract: This paper explores how forests and forest industry are perceived on the
    largest online discussion forum in Finland, Suomi24 ('Finland24'). Using 30,636
    posts published in 2014–2020, we investigate what kind of topics and perspectives
    towards forest management can be found. We use BERTopic as our topic modeling
    approach and evaluate the results of its different modular combinations. As the
    dataset is not labeled, we demonstrate the validity of our best model through
    illustrating some of the topics about forest use. The results show that a combination
    of UMAP and K-means leads to the best topic quality. Our exploratory qualitative
    analysis indicates that the posts reflect polarized discourses between the forest
    industry and forest conservation adherents.

  title: Perspectives on Forests and Forestry in Finnish Online Discussions - A Topic
    Modeling Approach to Suomi24
- abstract: This study explores the use of large language models (LLMs), specifically
    GPT-4o, to extract key ecological entities—species, locations, habitats, and ecosystems—from
    invasion biology literature. This information is critical for understanding species
    spread, predicting future invasions, and informing conservation efforts. Without
    domain-specific fine-tuning, we assess the potential and limitations of GPT-4o,
    out-of-the-box, for this task, highlighting the role of LLMs in advancing automated
    knowledge extraction for ecological research and management.

  title: 'Mining for Species, Locations, Habitats, and Ecosystems from Scientific
    Papers in Invasion Biology: A Large-Scale Exploratory Study with Large Language
    Models'
- abstract: This paper examines whether few-shot techniques for Named Entity Recognition
    (NER) utilising existing large language models (LLMs) as their backbone can be
    used to reliably annotate named entities (NEs) in scientific texts on climate
    change and biodiversity. A series of experiments aim to assess whether LLMs can
    be integrated into an end-to-end pipeline that could generate token- or sentence-level
    NE annotations; the former being an ideal-case scenario that allows for seamless
    integration of existing with new token-level features in a single annotation pipeline.
    Experiments are run on four LLMs, two NER datasets, two input and output data
    formats, and ten and nine prompt versions per dataset. The results show that few-shot
    methods are far from being a silver bullet for NER in highly specialised domains,
    although improvement in LLM performance is observed for some prompt designs and
    some NE classes. Few-shot methods would find better use in a human-in-the-loop
    scenario, where an LLM's output is verified by a domain expert.

  title: 'Large Language Models as Annotators of Named Entities in Climate Change
    and Biodiversity: A Preliminary Study'
- abstract: 'Contemporary environmental discourse focuses on effectively communicating
    ecological vulnerability to raise public awareness and encourage positive actions.
    Hence there is a need for studies to support accurate and adequate discourse production,
    both by humans and computers. Two main challenges need to be tackled. On the one
    hand, the language used to communicate about environment issues can be very complex
    for human and automatic analysis, there being few resources to train and test
    NLP tools. On the other hand, in the

    current international scenario, most texts are written in multiple languages or
    translated from a major to minor language, resulting in different meanings in
    different languages and cultural contexts.

    This paper presents a novel parallel corpus comprising the text of World Wide
    Fund (WWF) 2024 Annual Report in English and its translations into Italian and
    Brazilian Portuguese, and analyses their linguistic features.'

    analysis of the WWF24 multilingual corpus'
- abstract: 'Costa Rica is one of the largest producers and exporters of pineapple
    in the world. This status has encouraged multinational companies to use plantations
    in this Central American country for experimentation and the cultivation of new
    varieties, such as the Pinkglow pineapple. However, pineapple monoculture has
    significant socio-environmental impacts on the regions where it is cultivated.In
    this exploratory study, we aimed to analyze how pineapple production is portrayed
    on the Internet. To achieve this, we collected a corpus of texts in Spanish and
    English from online sources in two phases: using the BootCat tool and manual search
    on newspaper websites. The Hierarchical Dirichlet Process (HDP) topic model was
    then applied to identify dominant topics within the corpus. These topics were
    subsequently classified into thematic categories, and the texts were categorized
    accordingly. The findings indicate that environmental issues related to pineapple
    cultivation are underrepresented on the Internet, particularly in comparison to
    the extensive focus on topics related to pineapple production and marketing.'

    Analysis through Topic Modeling'
- abstract: Growing concerns about climate change and sustainability are driving manufacturers
    to take significant steps toward reducing their carbon footprints. For these manufacturers,
    a first step towards this goal is to identify the environmental impact of the
    individual components of their products. We propose a system leveraging large
    language models (LLMs) to automatically map components from manufacturer Bills
    of Materials (BOMs) to Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) database entries by using LLMs
    to expand on available component information. Our approach reduces the need for
    manual data processing, paving the way for more accessible sustainability practices.

  title: 'No AI on a Dead Planet: Sentiment and Emotion Analysis Across Reddit Communities
    on AI and the Environment'
- abstract: The widespread use of Large Language Models (LLMs), particularly among
    non-expert users, has raised ethical concerns about the propagation of harmful
    biases. While much research has addressed social biases, few works, if any, have
    examined anthropocentric bias in Natural Language Processing (NLP) technology.
    Anthropocentric language prioritizes human value, framing non-human animals, living
    entities, and natural elements solely by their utility to humans; a perspective
    that contributes to the ecological crisis. In this paper, we evaluate anthropocentric
    bias in OpenAI’s GPT-4o across various target entities, including sentient beings,
    non-sentient entities, and natural elements. Using prompts eliciting neutral,
    anthropocentric, and ecocentric perspectives, we analyze the model’s outputs and
    introduce a manually curated glossary of 424 anthropocentric terms as a resource
    for future ecocritical research. Our findings reveal a strong anthropocentric
    bias in the model's responses, underscoring the need to address human-centered
    language use in AI-generated text to promote ecological well-being.

  title: Towards Addressing Anthropocentric Bias in Large Language Models
- abstract: This study explores strategies for efficiently classifying scientific
    full texts using both small, BERT-based models and local large language models
    like Llama-3.1 8B. We focus on developing methods for selecting subsets of input
    sentences to reduce input size while simultaneously enhancing classification performance.
    To this end, we compile a novel dataset consisting of full-text scientific papers
    from the field of invasion biology, specifically addressing the impacts of invasive
    species. These papers are aligned with publicly available impact assessments created
    by researchers for the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN).
    Through extensive experimentation, we demonstrate that various sources like human
    evidence annotations, LLM-generated annotations or explainability scores can be
    used to train sentence selection models that improve the performance of both encoder-
    and decoder-based language models while optimizing efficiency through the reduction
    in input length, leading to improved results even if compared to models like ModernBERT
    that are able to handle the complete text as input. Additionally, we find that
    repeated sampling of shorter inputs proves to be a very effective strategy that,
    at a slightly increased cost, can further improve classification performance.

  title: 'Efficient Scientific Full Text Classification: The Case of EICAT Impact
    Assessments'
- abstract: A common language with shared standard definitions is essential for effective
    climate conversations. However, there is concern that LLMs may misrepresent and/or
    diversify climate-related terms. We compare 305 official IPCC glossary definitions
    with those generated by OpenAI's GPT-4o-mini and investigate their adherence,
    robustness, and readability using a combination of SBERT sentence embeddings and
    statistical measures. The LLM definitions received average adherence and robustness
    scores of $0.58 \pm 0.15$ and $0.96 \pm 0.02$, respectively. Both sustainability-related
    terminologies remain challenging to read, with model-generated definitions varying
    mainly among words with multiple or ambiguous definitions. Thus, the results highlight
    the potential of LLMs to support environmental discourse while emphasizing the
    need to align model outputs with established terminology for clarity and consistency.
